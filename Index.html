	<h2>
        After nearly two decades of marriage, David Grah and Mary Daniel, college sweethearts, divorced and have begun new lives. They agree that they are now better matched to others.
      </h2>
<h2> Where did they grow up? </h2>
      <h3>
        HE: In an San Francisco Bay Area suburb, the youngest of six children. His father was a professor, and mother a nurse.
      </h3>
      <h4>
        SHE: In Virginia also in a large family; her father was an Army colonel who served in Vietnam and bank president and investment adviser. 
      </h4>
	  <h2>
		How did they meet? <br> <br>
		At college, in 1982. After borrowing her typewriter, he invited her to a concert. From that night, they were together.
	  <br> What was it about the other?
	</h2>
	<h3>
		HE: She was attractive, intelligent, playful, with a positive way of looking at life.
	</h3>
	<h4>
		SHE: He was cute, composed, self-reliant and competent. 
	</h4>
	<h2>
		Why did they marry? <br> <br> 
		For nearly 10 years they were on and off, but more on than off. She was fairly certain he was the one, but sensed, rightly, that he wasn’t ready to commit. The long courtship worked for her, as she was busy with friends, school and work.
He had thought about marriage for a long time and finally realized they were the right age and “probably the right people for each other.” They both loved the outdoors; he proposed on a long hike.
<br>	<br> Were there red flags? 
</h2>
	<h3> 
		HE: Thinks that they always had fundamental misunderstandings about each other. “We have different styles of closeness, kind of a disconnect which was mysterious,” he said.
	</h3>
	<h4>
		SHE: Their need and desire for each other might not have been the same. “Maybe if I had more experience with intimacy, I would have seen that the love that we had then was not sustainable,” she said, “but I was in love and willing to follow him to the ends of the earth.” 
	</h4>
	<h2>
		Where did they live after marrying? <br> In a small community in the Eastern Sierra in California.
		<br> How were the early years?
	</h2>
	<h3>
		HE: “I loved her, but I felt lonely,” he said, “like I was missing something.”
	</h3>
	<h4>
		SHE: “Very good.” She rekindled a passion for riding horses; his passion was mountain climbing and flying hang-gliders and planes. “I don’t know if we were wise to allow our interests to diverge as much as they did,” she said, noting that they spent a lot of time apart.
	</h4>
	<h2>
		First signs of trouble? <br> <br> 
		After they had children, the challenges of parenting clarified that they were not always on the same page. 
		<h3>They didn’t agree on how to run the family. “Our family backgrounds are really different,” he said. “Her father was strict, and she is more like him than I thought she’d be.” But he acknowledged that their children have more opportunities because of the strong work ethic and values she instilled. 
“On weekends he would be in the mountains,” she said. “I was trying to be the best mom I knew how to be, but life has to be kid-centered.” In retrospect, she concedes that she focused on the children too much. “The more I was a mama bear, the more it didn’t work for him,” she said. <br>
Did they try to work on things or try therapy? <br> Yes, but he thought it was a forum for her to say the things she didn’t like about him. </h3>
</h2>
	<h4>
		She thought the therapist could have taken a stronger lead. “In therapy, I was a volcano bursting with emotion,” she said. “We didn’t understand how to talk to each other constructively, and it made me feel desperate.” She felt his anger and retreated sexually. “I felt like Dave didn’t want to do what I thought we needed to do.”
	</h4>
	<h2>
		Strongest feeling at the time?
	</h2>
	<h3> 
		He remembers feeling as if he were the least important person to her. “Kids, neighbors, friends all were higher on her list,” he said.
	</h3>
	<h4>
		She said, “I think we both felt stranded and alone.”
	</h4>

	<h2>
		Who asked for the split?
	</h2>
<div class="div3">
		<p>“It was not unexpected,” he said. “I was sad but also relieved.” </p>
	</div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
		<p>She did, in March 2009. After a tension-filled evening, she quickly figured out logistically how they could split and within two months had rented a house nearby. He didn’t think it was the best thing for the children or good financially, but for a long time he had no hope about the relationship.
	</p>
		</div>
	<h2>
		How did their children, then 10 and 12, react?
	</h2>
	<div class="div3">
		<p>They told the children they were separating. He thought that the children expected them to get back together, but he soon became involved with someone who had also left her marriage. “It was not in my plan to get involved so quickly, but it was powerful, positive, and I was happy,” he said. </p>
	</div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
		<p>She was heartbroken and disappointed, but also relieved to be out of the house. “It had been painful for a long time,” she said.
		</p>
		</div class="div4">
	<h2>
		How did they move on?
	</h2>
	<div class="div3">
	<p>	HE: Having someone else in his life made moving on automatic. </p>
	</div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
		<p>SHE: It took a long time to disengage emotionally. She built up a network of friends and focused on the children.
	</p>
		</div class="div4">
	<h2>
		Did they feel stigmatized?
	</h2>
	<div class="div3">
	<p> HE: No, or not that he was aware of.</p>
	</div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
		<p>SHE: Yes, she felt as if she had a poster on her back that read, “I’m divorcing.” At a stop sign, a man came up to her car window, gave her a hug and walked away. “It’s a small town, people were talking,” she said. </p>
	</div class="div4">
	<h2>
		How did they fare financially?
	</h2>
	<div class="div3">
		<p> HE: Worse, but he found it a relief to separate their finances. “Our financial practices were always incompatible, and that was a difficulty in our marriage. All I have to do now is make my monthly payment.” </p>
	</div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
		<p>SHE: He has met his obligations, but her life has become more stressful financially.
Should they have divorced sooner? </p>
	</div class="div4">
	<h2>
		Both say “probably” but that the children made it complicated. Each wondered whether staying together for the children was the right thing to do. “Or maybe it happened just right,” he said.
<br>
		Are their new relationships different?
	</h2>
	<div class="div3">
		<p> HE: Yes, he feels special and appreciated. “We’re nice to each other and much more affectionate,” he said. “I’m not sure I am different, but the person I am with is different.” </p>
	</div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
	<p>	SHE: Has a long-distance relationship in which she feels very different. “Now, I can talk through anything even if it’s painful,” she said. “ I’ve learned I have something to offer.” </p>
	</div class="div4">
	<h2>
		Would they have done anything differently?
	</h2>
	<div class="div4">
		<p>SHE: “Insisted, to the best of my ability, that we spend more time together.” </p>
	</div class="div4">
	<div class="div3">
	<p>	HE: Doesn’t know. “Try as we might, we couldn’t get rid of each either. We kept going back to each other, and we have great kids.” </p>
	</div class="div3">
	<h2>
		Is their new life better?
	</h2>
	<div class="div3">
	<p>	HE: Yes. </p>
	</div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
	<p>	SHE: “Do I miss him? Yes. Do I feel we should be together? No.” </p>
	</div class="div4">
	<h2>
		What advice would they offer?
	</h2>
	<div class="div3">
	<p>	HE: “When you’re young, you’re not that wise. Still, it’s good to do your best and be kind.” </p> </div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
	<p>	SHE: “People can love each other very much and not be suited for a sustainable partnership. We fall into that category. When I think of Dave now, I think of our best times.” </p>
	</div class="div4">
	<h2>
		What is life like now?
	</h2>
<div class="div3">
	<p>	HE: “I feel good,” he said. “My relationship is good.” </p>
	</div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
	<p>SHE: Friends, activities, family and great children. Lots of change and a lot of promise ahead. </p>
	</div class="div4">
	<h2>
		Has either person changed?
	</h2>
<div class="div3">
	<p>	HE: A little wiser. “But I am essentially the same as when I was 13,” he said, “which is what likely makes me difficult.” </p>
	</div class="div3">
	<div class="div4">
	<p>	SHE: Has more self-awareness and is more discerning about relationships. </p></div class="div4">
	<h2>
		Advice for others divorcing.
	</h2>
<div class="div3">
	<p>	HE: Remember that all relationships aren’t bad. “Mary and I are special to each other,” he said, “but our circles don’t overlap on purpose.” </p>
	</div class="div3">
<div class="div4">
	<p>	SHE: Start the work of marriage when the marriage begins, not when it’s too late. Develop empathy and communication skills for the good times and the bad. When you marry in your 20s, it’s a high risk. It’s hard to see what’s ahead. </p>
	</div class="div4">
